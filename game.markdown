## Game Mechanics

### Strategic Gameplay

- **Movement System**: Players can either duplicate pieces to adjacent hexes or jump two spaces to expand territory
- **Conversion Mechanics**: Successfully placed pieces convert adjacent opponent pieces to your side
- **Victory Conditions**: Win by controlling the most territory when no moves remain or by eliminating opponent pieces
- **Tactical Depth**: Balance between expansion, defense, and strategic positioning
