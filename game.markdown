## Overview

Capitol Conquest is a modern, Hexxagon-style strategy game built with Phaser 3. Two parties compete for control on a hexagonal grid through tactical moves that duplicate or jump pieces and convert adjacent opponent tiles. The game includes adaptive AI with multiple difficulty levels, real-time online multiplayer, builtâ€‘in chat, analytics, and responsive UX across devices.

## AI Implementation

The computer opponent uses a greedy, single-depth heuristic that balances multiple factors. Each candidate move is simulated and scored using a weighted combination of:

- Material advantage (piece differential)
- Limiting opponent mobility (reduce their next moves)
- Central control (prefer positions closer to the board center)
- Risk avoidance (penalize exposed positions)
- Small randomness (jitter) to prevent repetition

Different difficulty levels adjust weights and starting advantages to create distinct play styles and challenge levels.

## Online Multiplayer System

Real-time multiplayer features include instant matchmaking, synchronized turns via WebSockets, and reliability features for production use.

- Instant matchmaking with room-based pairing (two players per room)
- Live turn updates and server-side validation of game state
- Reconnection handling and disconnect win assignment
- Waiting room UI with loading animation
- Party-colored chat available throughout the match

Architecture highlights:

- Socket.IO server with Express.js backend
- Room management and turn validation on the server
- PM2 configuration for production uptime

## Statistics & Analytics

Global and per-mode stats are captured for online matches:

- Real-time write to Google Sheets via Google Apps Script
- Win/loss tracking, game duration, difficulty, mode, and timestamps
- Recent games view and performance analysis
- Analytics via Google Tag Manager for user engagement and performance

---

## User Interface & UX

- Branded title and themed party colors throughout the UI
- Responsive menus with hover/touch feedback and clear state indicators
- Keyboard support (arrow keys, Enter) and accessible defaults
- Mobile optimizations for dynamic viewports, touch targets, and typography

## Game Rules

### Objective
Control more tiles than your opponent when all playable hexes are filled.

### How to Play
1. Choose your side (ðŸ”´ Republicans or ðŸ”µ Democrats)
2. Select a mode (Single Player, Local Two-Player, or Online)
3. For single player, pick a difficulty: Normal, Hard, or Expert
4. On your turn, either:
   - Duplicate to an adjacent hex (distance 1), or
   - Jump up to two hexes (distance 2)
5. After moving, adjacent enemy tiles flip to your color
6. The game ends when no moves remain; majority wins

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch: tap/click to select and move
- Keyboard: arrow keys to navigate menus, Enter to select
- ESC: return to menu; F: toggle fullscreen
- Music control available in the UI; chat in online matches
